It tells you jokes.Hopefully you like puns.
There's a free version and a paid version. The free version has ads and requires you to buy credits once you use the
pre-supplied credits. The paid version has the same jokes (don't tell anyone) but no ads. Uses a separate library to
provide jokes from a Google Cloud Endpoint, and another separate Android library to display those jokes.

Uses Butterknife, AdMob, GCE, custom libraries.
